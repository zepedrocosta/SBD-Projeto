\section{Overview of HammerDB}
\label{sec:hammerdb}

HammerDB is a free, open-source tool for benchmarking the performance of relational databases \cite{enwiki:1275860580}. 

It supports popular databases like Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more. HammerDB uses industry-standard workloads such as TPROC-C and TPROC-H to simulate real-world database activity. 

It offers both a graphical interface and command-line options, making it suitable for developers, DBAs, and system administrators to test, compare, and tune database performance.

\subsection{Overview of TPROC-C}
\label{sec:tproc-c}

TPROC-C is a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of database management systems (DBMS) using a transactional workload. It simulates a typical online transaction processing (OLTP) environment, focusing on operations like inserts, updates, and deletes across multiple tables.
